# Screenshot Placeholders

The screenshots referenced in README.md should be placed here:

- `overview.png` - ⏳ Take this screenshot
- `confident-wrong.png` - ⏳ Take this screenshot
- `inspector.png` - ⏳ Take this screenshot
- `calibration.png` - ⏳ Take this screenshot

See [SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md](../SCREENSHOT_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

## Temporary: Using Placeholder URLs

Until you add real screenshots, the README will show broken image icons.
This is normal - add your screenshots before sharing with interviewers.

## Alternative

You can also use issue with image upload in GitHub:
1. Create a new GitHub Issue in your repo
2. Drag & drop screenshots into the comment
3. Copy the generated URLs
4. Use those URLs in README instead of relative paths
